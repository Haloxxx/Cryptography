# Cryptography
A few implementations of cryptological algorithms for ,,Kryptografia" (Cryptography) subject.


Algorithms:
1. Vigener - encryption and analysis
2. S-DES - 8-bit version of DES with a symmetric key
3. Mini-AES - Version of AES working on 16-bit text blocks.
4. Lucas Test (based on fast modulo exponentiation and Fermat's factorization method)
5. RSA (based on sieve of Eratosthenes and extended Euclidean algorithm)
6. ElGamal encryption
7. Hash function and digital signature
